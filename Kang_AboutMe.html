			<p>
	My name is Matthew Kang. I am a junior at Dublin High School in Dublin, 
	California and am working towards a career in either chemical, biomedical or 
	mechanical engineering. Regardless of the branch of engineering I pursue, I 
	wish to utilize my knowledge to protect the environment and help those in need. 
	To this end, I plan to major in one of these three fields in college, and 
	apply what I learn to the world at large. 
			</p>

			<p>
	As a child I developed a great love for solving problems, so when I was 
	introduced to engineering in the 5th grade I naturally gravitated towards 
	the engineering disciplines. My path to engineering began when I took the 
	summer course, Intro to PLTW, offered by DPIE in 2013. Even though it was a 
	summer course, and meant waking up early for six weeks, I enjoyed it 
	immensely, and it allowed me to engage in a variety of engineering-related 
	activities. I became interested in programming and robotics, participating 
	in First Lego League throughout middle school, and learning to code in Python. 
	In High School, I was a member of the Dublin High School 5327A VEX robotics 
	team that went to the 2018 Worlds VEX Championship at Louisville, Kentucky, 
	and I was enrolled in Principles of Engineering, and currently in Computer 
	Science Principles. As a part of a robotics team and in an engineering class, 
	I am starting to build my intellectual muscle within the various engineering 
	disciplines. 
			</p>

			<p>
	The phrase, “put in the work” was drilled into me at a young age and is my 
	family’s guiding principle. These words are at the heart of the young man I 
	am becoming, and something I hope to inspire in others by example. When 
	executing any school or engineering-related projects, I make it a point to 
	ensure that the work is evenly divided among my peers because no one should 
	be overburdened and feel unfairly put upon. The even distribution of work 
	helps to create a good team dynamic, which promotes collaboration, an 
	essential factor towards achieving goals as a team. 
			</p>

			<p>
	Work is also important in achieving success in sports. Sports are a part of 
	my core memory. I love competition, and thrive in pressure situations. One 
	of my biggest achievements was placing 5th place in the 2016 USATF Junior 
	Olympic National Championships, where I was recognized as a 2016 Junior 
	Olympic All American for placing in the top eight for the 800 meter (13-14 
	age division). My work-ethic is what defines my value, individually or within 
	a team or group dynamic. In projects, my coding skills, my communicating skills, 
	and ability to lead a group allows my group to complete projects efficiently 
	and accurately. My work-ethic is also a reason for my academic excellence, 
	having achieved an unweighted GPA of 3.93 and cumulative GPA of 4.43.  
			</p>

			<p>
	No one in my family has pursued a career in engineering, and I strive to be 
	the first. I am determined to continue to learn and gain valuable experiences 
	before leaving Dublin High in the two years I have remaining. My experiences 
	have taught me that hard work pays off. Through my diligent efforts as the 
	Vice President of the California Junior Scholarship Federation, we raised a 
	record breaking amount of money ever raised by a Middle School organization 
	in Dublin resulting in a nomination for the Dublin Organization of the Year, 
	2016. My time as Vice President have allowed me to inspire others to put in 
	the work and make a difference, and to this day I want to set a precedent 
	for others to follow and build off of, because ultimately, I want to see 
	everyone succeed.
