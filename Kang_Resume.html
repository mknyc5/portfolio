		<h3 class="workexp">Work Experience</h3>
		<p>	As a part of the Dublin High Engineering Academy, I have the privilege
		of being a part of the Mentorship Program, and meeting many speakers who came
		to talk about their experiences. Furthermore, as a member of the Gael Force
		Robotics Club, I had the opportunity to go to Louisville, Kentucky for the
		2018 VEX World Championship. All of these experiences have exposed me to 
		the many careers of engineering available, and have allowed me to expand
		my knowledge on STEM jobs and opportunities for the future. 
		</p>
		
		<p>	At the start of my Junior year, the Mentorship Program paired me with 
		Caleb Lystrup, a Las Vegas Native that is the co-founder for Khione Outdoor
		Gear which he started with his friend after winning a Student Innovation 
		Contest at BYU. Caleb has a Ph.D in mechanical engineering and currently
		works for Sandia National Laboratories. Already after 3 months of the 
		Mentorship Program, I learned about planning for the future, how to present
		myself in a resume, and career choices I maybe interested in pursuing. Caleb
		has been a great mentor, and he challenges me to not only be a better student,
		but to be a better person. In August 2018, Caleb challenged me to talk 
		with someone who looks left out, whether he or she is sitting alone or 
		isolating themselves. I immediately took up on this challenge, and I sat 
		with a freshman who actually moved to Dublin very recently from Germany. 
		His name was Tyrees, and he lived in a military family. Despite having to 
		constantly move, and create new friends every time, he was surprisingly 
		positive and was overall a great guy. I had an amazing time talking with
		him about the different life he had in Germany and learning more about him. 
		This went on for a month, and eventually we exchanged instagrams. Eventually, 
		Tyrees was able to make new friends at Dublin High, and soon he was spending
		time with different freshmen, laughing and talking about video games and school. 
		In a short period of time, the Mentorship Program has rewarded me with many
		memorable experiences that I will cherish. 
		</p>
		
		<!-- Will add more guest speakers in future. Only have 1 because I cannot recall previous guest speakers -->	
		<p>The Engineering Academy also organizes guest speakers that present 
		during our class time. These presentations provide us insight into different 
		fields of engineering, as well as the education necessary to enter the 
		workforce. One speaker that was really influential was Joel Rosales, a 
		2nd lieutenant for the Air Force ROTC. Working for the military has always
		been in the back of my mind, but Joel brought these thoughts to surface, and
		revealed the many benefits he receives for serving the country.	Mr. Rosales's 
		presentation had a great impact on me because it showed me how
		a career in engineering can be so impactful and be able to do good for 
		the nation.
		</p>
		
		<p>My sophomore year, I took a break from Cross Country. I realized that
		running was consuming my school life including time to do any other 
		extracullicular activities. Although, I underperformed during Track season,
		this decision has greatly impacted my life, because I was able to do 
		other things than running. August 2017, I joined the Gael Force VEX Robotics
		Club, and little did I knew that I was in for a ride. After being a part 
		of the Development Team of the Club for 2 months, I was invited to intern
		for one of the four competitive robotics team, 5327A or Gael Force A. Eventually,
		I became an official member of 5327A. There were eight of us in total,
		and so we all filled up our captain's garage, tinkering and making changes
		to the robot and the code. Hours and hours were spent on weekdays and 
		weekends to create a consistent and efficient robot. Through our hard work,
		we were able to qualify for the 2018 VEX Robotics World Championship which
		took place in Louisville, Kentucky. Through robotics, I was able to meet new
		people, learn to work in a team environment, deal with time	crunches 
		and stressful situations. I loved how I was able to utilize what I have learned
		in previous engineering courses and apply them in real-life situations rather
		than in word problems. Overall, I had no regrets for not doing Cross 
		Country.
