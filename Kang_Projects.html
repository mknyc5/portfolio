		<p> Project Name: Compound Machine; Tennis Ball K-9 Cannon </p>
		<p>Course: Principles of Engineering</p>
		<p>Project Duration: 8/31/17 - 9/9/17</p>
		<p>Project Type: Group</p>
		<p>Objective: Design, Build, and Test a Prototype of a Machine that can Complete an Everyday Task</p>
	
		<p>
			The objective of this project, was to construct a compound machine that 
			completes an everyday task. In this project, groups had to turn in a single 
			document that contained their design proposal, modifications, and final design. 
			Furthermore, the compound machine needed to utilize four simple machines and 
			must be powered by a single human input. This all had to be done in six days, 
			and after brainstorming, me and my group decided to create a ball throwing 
			machine through the use of a high gear ratio compound train.  I was the project
			manager for my group, and I lead the team in the documentation of our project, 
			doing most of the documentation, recording all of the modifications made, and 
			writing the final design descriptions. I also worked as the assistant builder 
			proposed numerous ideas in order to make the tennis ball shooter better. 
		</p>
		<p>
			From this project, I learned how to document any modifications made during 
			the project, and how to construct a formal design brief. I also learned more
			about the importance of reducing friction within mechanisms, and methods to 
			reduce friction within mechanisms. This project exemplified my ability to 
			lead a project, and create a working environment that allowed my group to 
			complete the project effectively, and finish earlier than the deadline.

		<p> Project Name: Solar Hydrogen Vehicle Project </p>
		<p>Course: Principles of Engineering</p>
		<p>Project Duration: 11/1/17 - 11/17/17</p>
		<p>Project Type: Group</p>
		<p>Objective: Design, Build, and Test a Vehicle powered by either solar or 
		hydrogen fuel cells</p>
		
		<p>The Solar Hydrogen Vehicle Project was a three person project that required 
		a recommendation for Tesla Motors, regarding whether they should use solar 
		or hydrogen fuel and how they should wire the cells on a bread board. For 
		this project our group had to test various configurations of fuel cells on 
		a vehicle of our design for efficiency, speed, and practicality. During the 
		project, I took lead on documentation and building the vehicle. 
		I documented all of our modifications and recorded our vehicle's time results. 
		After trying many different combinations of hydrogen cells and solar panels,
		we ultimately used 2 hydrogen cells, configured in a parallel circuit. 
		After our testing we concluded that the hydrogen fuel cells produced the 
		greatest speed. However practicality of our source is low, because hydrogen 
		fuel cells are still very inefficient, and are heavy. In todays market, 
		hydrogen fuel cars are not widely advertised due to its inefficiencies. 
		Furthermore, our inability to obtain functioning solar panels may have skewed 
		our results. However, based off our group's experiences with hydrgoen fuel cells
		and solar panels, we ultimately recommend 2 hydrogen fuel cells wired in parallel 
		to Tesla.</p>

		<p> Project Name: Scratch Project</p>
		<p>Course: Computer Science Principles</p>
		<p>Project Duration: 8/30/18 - 9/15/18</p>
		<p>Project Type: Partner</p>
		<p>Objective: Design a storyline or a game using the scratch interface</p>
		
		<p>The Scratch Project was a two person project that involved using the interface
		Scratch. For this project we had to choose to develop either a story or a 
		game. My partner, Keenan, and I decided to create a game that fuses the 
		concepts of a storyline and game. It centered around a student named Mike 
		who did not want to be at school. Mike then interacts with the user, asking 
		for his/her name and asks if he/she would like to escape school with him. 
		Once the user says yes, they must help Mike escape the teacher and school by 
		controlling him to avoid obstacles that come in the way. As he gets closer to home, 
		the obstacles become harder and more freqeuent. The game ends after surviving 
		a certain amount of loops that we defined as levels. During this 
		project I learned how to work in a team while programming as well as how to 
		change our game for the benefit of the players of the game. A 
		main component of this game was variables and globals since there was a lot 
		of data to keep track of, and a need to be able to transition into a different 
		level. Feel free to play our project by clicking the play button on the right.
